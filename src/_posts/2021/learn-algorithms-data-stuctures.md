title: Wanna learn Algorithms and Data Structures? Here are the links...
description: I came across several requests asking what resources can be used to learn Algorithms and Data Structures. This topic teaches at formal Computer Science courses and may be presented in different languages. For those who want to learn in their own time and at their own pace see links below.
